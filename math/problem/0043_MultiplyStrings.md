# 43. Multiply Strings

```Medium, Math, String```

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

**Note:**

1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 110.
2. Both `num1` and `num2` contain only digits `0-9`.
3. Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
4. You **must not use any built-in BigInteger library** or **convert the inputs to integer**directly.

**Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public String multiply(String num1, String num2) {
        
    }
}
```
