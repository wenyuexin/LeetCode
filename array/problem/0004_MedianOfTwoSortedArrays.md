# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays [[Go](https://github.com/Apollo4634/LeetCode/tree/master/src/array/solution/MedianOfTwoSortedArrays_4.java)]

```Hard, Array, Binary Search, Divide and Conquer```

**Description**

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.

**Example 1:**

```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

**Example 2:**

```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

**Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        
    }
}
```
