# 16. 3 Sum Closest [[Go](https://github.com/Apollo4634/LeetCode/tree/master/src/array/solution/ThreeSumClosest_16.java)]

```Medium, Array, Two Pointers```

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**

```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```
**Java**
```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        
    }
}
```
