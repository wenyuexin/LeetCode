# 38. Count and Say [[Go](https://github.com/Apollo4634/LeetCode/tree/master/src/string/solution/CountAndSay_38.java)]

```Easy, String```

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

**Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        
    }
}
```
