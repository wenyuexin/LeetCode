# 133. Clone Graph [[Go](https://github.com/Apollo4634/LeetCode/tree/master/src/depth_first_search/solution/CloneGraph_133.java)]

```Medium, Depth-firsh Search, Breadth-firsh Search, Graph```

Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

 

**Example:**

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node *p* has node *q* as neighbor, then node *q* must have node *p* as neighbor too.
4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.



**Java**

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        
    }
}
```
