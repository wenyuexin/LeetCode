# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group [[Go](https://github.com/Apollo4634/LeetCode/tree/master/src/linked_list/solution/ReverseNodesInKGroup_25.java)]

```Hard, Linked List```

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k*then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.



**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

**Java**

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        
    }
}
```
