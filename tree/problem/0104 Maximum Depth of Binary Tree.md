# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

```Easy, Tree, Depth-first Search```

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its depth = 3.

**Java**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        
    }
}
```
