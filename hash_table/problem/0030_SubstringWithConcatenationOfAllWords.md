# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words [[Go](https://github.com/Apollo4634/LeetCode/tree/master/src/hash_table/solution/SubstringWithConcatenationOfAllWords_30.java)]

```Hard, Hash Table, Two Pointers, String```

You are given a string, **s**, and a list of words, **words**, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in **s** that is a concatenation of each word in **words** exactly once and without any intervening characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```

**Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        
    }
}
```
